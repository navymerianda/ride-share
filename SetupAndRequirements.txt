Installation Requirements:

1. Make sure to have Python 3 or above installed.
2. We will require 3 external libraries:
   pip install -U python-dotenv
   -> Reads the key-value pair from env file and adds them to environment variables.

   pip install FastAPI
   -> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

   pip install uvicorn[standard]
   -> You will also need an ASGI server, for production such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn. 

   pip install requests
   -> Helps us make HTTP requests to external APIs.


3. API usage restrictions:
   -> Although, I have used the AZURE_KEY in this case for our demonstration purposes. Not to be used beyond 50 requests/second.

4. Once everything is installed; we can run the following command to see the service in action:
   -> uvicorn main:app --reload

5. Open the browser:
   -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   # You will see an automatic interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI
